# TouchScript — multi-touch framework for Unity3d
TouchScript is a family of multi-touch frameworks for Unity3d and Flash. It is much more than a handful of routines to receive touch events from different sources. Inspired by iOS, TouchScript makes handling complex gesture interactions on large touch surfaces much easier. Unity3d and Flash implementations are developed to work together in Scaleform environment.
